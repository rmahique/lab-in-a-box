# More Examples

A larger collection of ready-to-adapt lab definitions, kept here instead of in the main
[README](README.md#examples) so that file doesn't get too cluttered. Same format, same

## AlmaLinux, Debian, Rocky Linux, Alibaba Cloud Linux — a mixed cloud-image lab

Four different distros in one lab. `common.VM_MEM`/`VM_CPU` here are intentionally small (1
vCPU, 2 GiB) — enough for a quick smoke test of the distro itself, not a real workload. `VM_DSK`
is set per-node to each source image's own real floor (see
[Deploying a legacy image (CentOS 7)](README.md#deploying-a-legacy-image-centos-7) for what
happens if it's set below that).

Confirmed live 2026-09-03 — and **two of the four needed real per-node fixes**, found only by
actually booting them and checking: AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux worked with every default
unchanged, but Debian and Alibaba Cloud Linux each hit a genuinely different problem.

> [!NOTE]
> Debian ships a second, genuinely cloud-init-less "nocloud" image variant (filenames like
> `debian-13-nocloud-amd64.qcow2`) — that one needs `config_method: "virt_customize"` instead,
> and the preflight check will warn if you use `cloud-init` with it.

> [!NOTE]
> Alibaba's own hostname-management service resets the guest's hostname after boot regardless
> of what `virt_customize`/cloud-init set it to — SSH, the static IP, and root login all work
> correctly, but don't be surprised if `hostname` reports something other than the node name.

## Raspberry Pi OS (aarch64) — not yet supported

**Status: investigated live 2026-09-03, not working yet — documented here as a known limitation,
not a working example.** Unlike every other image in this project, Raspberry Pi OS is a genuine
architecture mismatch: this project's hypervisors are x86_64, and the official
`*-raspios-*-arm64.img` releases are aarch64 raw disk images built specifically for real
Raspberry Pi hardware's own GPU-firmware boot chain (`bootcode.bin`/`start*.elf`/`config.txt`),
not a UEFI or BIOS boot path at all — `config_method`/`VM_MACHINE` as they exist today have
nothing to attach to here.

What's confirmed so far:

- QEMU (`qemu-arm` + `qemu-uefi-aarch64` packages) provides real `-M raspi3b`/`raspi4b` machine
  models that emulate actual Pi hardware closely enough to be the right starting point — a
  generic `-M virt` aarch64 machine is the wrong target (different SoC, different everything;
  the Pi's own `kernel8.img` won't recognize it).
- The SD card image itself must be resized to a power-of-2 size for QEMU's SD emulation
  (`if=sd`) to accept it — e.g. a 6.05 GiB source needs `qemu-img resize` to 8 GiB, not just
  "big enough".
- Raspberry Pi OS's boot partition already ships a genuine cloud-init NoCloud datasource
  (`/boot/firmware/user-data`, `network-config`, `meta-data` — Raspberry Pi Imager's own
  official customization mechanism), so once it boots, configuring it should need no new
  mechanism at all.
- Getting any boot console output at all has not succeeded yet: `enable_uart=1` in
  `config.txt` and the mini-UART/PL011 dual-`-serial` split (both commonly cited fixes for
  "no console output on raspi4b") were tried against a real image with no result. QEMU's
  `raspi3b`/`raspi4b` machine models are upstream-acknowledged as still incomplete for exactly
  this kind of peripheral fidelity.

Not attempted yet: confirming boot succeeds at all (with working console output), wiring a
new backend/config_method path for cross-architecture boot, and figuring out how this
project's existing virtio-based network/disk conventions map onto the Pi's own USB-network and
SD-card-only hardware model (raspi3b/4b have no PCI bus, so none of `VM_NET_MODEL`/
`VM_DSK_BUS`'s existing values apply).
