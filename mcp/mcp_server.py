mcp_server.py — lets an MCP client (an LLM agent) drive lab-in-a-box.

Runs as its own root-owned service DIRECTLY on the automation VM (a plain
systemd unit / lab-mcp-ctl-managed process — see
install_automation_node_scripts.sh), NOT containerized, and separate from
the webui's Apache-user CGI (webui/cgi-bin/labbuilder.py's own header
comment is explicit that it "never builds labs or runs anything
privileged" — this server does the opposite on purpose, so it must not
share that process/user). Containerizing it was the original design and
was tried first — reverted after live-testing (2026-08-29) showed its
mutating tools need full, unsandboxed host access that a container's
isolated namespace can't reasonably provide: virsh/virt-install (via
libvirt's qemu+ssh transport) and, more fundamentally, DNS record
management, which reads/writes BIND's local zone files and restarts the
LOCAL named service directly — there's no remote/SSH equivalent for that
since BIND already runs on this exact host. Its own third-party Python
deps (mcp/uvicorn, the only third-party deps anywhere in this otherwise
stdlib-only project) still live in a dedicated venv
(/etc/lab-mcp/venv), so they stay isolated from the rest of the system's
Python environment even without a container.

Read-only tools (list_components/get_schema/get_base_schema/get_status/
validate_lab/save_lab) are thin wrappers around webui/lib/api.py's
dispatch() — the exact same operation set the webui itself uses, reused not
reimplemented.

Mutating tools (deploy_lab/rebuild_lab/destroy_lab/destroy_vm) call
setup_lab.py/destroy_lab.py/destroy_vm.py's own already-importable functions
in-process — never a subprocess. They are only REGISTERED (visible to a
client at all) when /etc/lab_creation.cfg's MCP_ALLOW_MUTATIONS is true;
default is read-only-only. Every mutating call requires a `confirm` string
that must exactly equal the target identifier being acted on (not a plain
"yes"/true) — see _require_confirm() — and every call, accepted or
rejected, is appended to MCP_AUDIT_LOG.

deploy_lab vs. rebuild_lab: deploy_lab always runs with keep=True semantics
(never destroys/recreates an existing VM matching a node name). Only
rebuild_lab can destroy+recreate matching VMs — a separate, unmistakably-
named tool rather than a keep=False parameter on deploy_lab, so an agent has
to deliberately choose the destructive one.

Transport: MCP Python SDK v2's streamable_http_app(), served over mTLS via
uvicorn (ssl_cert_reqs=CERT_REQUIRED against a local CA — see
lab-mcp-issue-client-cert and install_automation_node_scripts.sh's cert
generation, which mirrors the existing self-signed-cert pattern already
used for the webui's own HTTPS). A request without a client cert signed by
that CA is rejected at the TLS layer, before any tool dispatch happens.

NOT verified against a real MCP client or a real lab — this needs a real
end-to-end round trip (a real MCP client over mTLS, a real deploy/destroy
against a disposable lab on nuc6.mydemo.lab) before being trusted in
production. Mocked tests cover the confirm-gate/audit-log/registration
logic and that the mutating tools call through with the exact args — not
protocol-level interop or real infrastructure.
