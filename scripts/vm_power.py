"""
vm_power.py — power state / start / stop of a lab's VMs, whatever backend
created them (libvirt KVM hosts are usually handled with virsh directly; this
is mainly for cloud backends, where a stopped lab costs less than a running one
and far less than one left running by accident).

Usage:
    vm_power.py <lab-file> status [vm ...]
    vm_power.py <lab-file> start  [vm ...]
    vm_power.py <lab-file> stop   [vm ...]
    vm_power.py --example <name> {status|start|stop} [vm ...]

Options:
    --cloud-account <name>  use cloud account <name> for every cloud node of this run,
                            taking precedence over "cloud_account" in the definition.
    --example <name>        act on the lab built by setup_lab.py --example <name>, for
                            which no lab file of your own exists.
    --no-wait               do not wait for each VM to reach the state asked for, and do
                            not order the lab's own VMs (below). One call per VM, as this
                            command behaved before ordering existed.
    --no-dns                on start, do not register the lab's DNS again. Only useful when
                            every node has a fixed address.

Prints one JSON object, {vm name: state}. A backend without power support
reports "unsupported"; any other failure reports "error: <message>" and makes
the exit code 1. Without vm names: every node of the lab, plus the VMs the lab
brought up for itself, and for start and stop in an order that suits the lab
rather than the file:

  stop   Kubernetes agents, then servers, then the infrastructure VMs the lab
         brought up for itself (each site's cloud DNS VM and overlay gateway).
  start  the reverse, so the DNS and the overlay are up before the nodes that
         resolve and reach each other through them, and each cloud node's DNS
         records are written again afterwards, because a provider that releases
         a public address on stop hands back a different one on start.

With explicit vm names, those VMs are acted on in the order given and nothing
else is touched.

Stopping is not a saving everywhere: each backend says what it does to the bill
(backends.VMBackend.stop_billing_note()), printed on stderr with every stop.
